# Tokens

The tokens endpoint serves the purpose to provide the client user a safe way to either request a safe, expirable token to interact with the rest of the API or to change credentials such as a password reset.

Notice that tokens have an expiration date, depending on the type of token. Session tokens will last for 1 hour whereas password reset tokens will last for 1 day. If you get an unauthorized error you should request a new token.

## Create

> Roles: **admin**, **customer**

Creates a new token for the given type. You should use this endpoint to request a _"session"_ token so you can interact with the rest of the application.


### Request

`POST /tokens`

 - **token[user][email]** *Required.* Email of the user to create the token for.
 - **token[user][password]** *Optional.* Password for the user requesting the token. Only necessary when requesting a `session` type of token.

### Payload

# Users

The users endpoints allow interaction with user type resources and can be used to manage them. Although there are enpoints for all RESTful operations only a handful are available for regular users and are restricted for their own resource data. All other operations require admin permissions.

## Create

> Roles: **admin**

Creates a new user with the given data. This endpoint is restricted to admin operations. By default, when creating a new user a new wallet account will be created as well with a balance of 0.

 - **Content-Type** *Optional*. The type of content being sent to the server. If the payload does not contain any binaries such as files or images the recommended is `application/json` otherwise it is recommended to use `multipart/form-data`.
 - **X-User-Email** *Required*. The email of the user account making the request.
 - **X-User-Token** *Required*. The secret token of the user to make the request. You can get one by using the `/tokens` endpoint.

### Parameters

 - **user[email]** *Required*. The email of the new user account to create.
 - **user[password]** *Optional*. A temporary password for the newly created user. If none is set, a random password will be generated.
 - **user[first_name]** *Required.* The new user's first name.
 - **user[last_name]** *Required.* The new user's last name.
 - **user[role]** *Optional.* Role for the new user. This can be either `customer` or `admin`. If none is given it will fallback to a customer.
 - **user[status]** *Optional.* The status of the user once created. Can be any of `active` to immediately have the user activated _(useful when providing password)_ `unconfirmed` if the user requires confirmation by email or `disabled` to create the user but have the account disabled to interact with the API. Fallsback to `unconfirmed` if none given.

### Payload

# Transactions

Transactions are the basis of the wallet system. A transaction represents an operation between entities that affects balances of both sides, even for operations not involving electronic money. For instance, a _wallet_ to _wallet_ transfer of electronic money is the most common, however, there are other operations that a user can do such as recharging the wallet or withdrawing the money.

These transactions are always made on behalf of the calling client wallet, that is, all created transactions happen because one of the ends is the client's wallet.

For these transactions there exist different types of operations:

 1. A wallet to wallet transfer. For instance, customer John Doe transfering e-money to Jane Smith.
 2. A wallet deposit, that is, when the customer wishes to add credit to the wallet from a debit or a credit card.
 3. A wallet withdrawal, when the customer wants to move money away from the wallet outside the system to a debit or a credit card.

There are another two types of operations which cannot be created by the user but can appear on balances and they happen internally and automatically:

 1. A flat fee that is applied when a wallet to wallet operation occurs, where the payee is charged such amount. The fee depends on the amount being transfered and these fees can be consulted in the `fees` endpoint.
 2. A variable rate fee which is applied when a wallet to wallet operation occurs, where the payee is charged such amount which is calculated as the `(amount x rate)`. The fee depends on the amount being transfered and these fees can be consulted in the `fees` endpoint.

Client can provide an amount and a description for the transfer so it reminds of the reason of the operation.

Once an operation suceeds the current balance will be stored for historial reasons and to generate a useful statement. There is a field called `reference` which is used internally and will store a reference to a parent transaction in the case that the transaction was the consequence of another which is the case of the fees.

Since transactions are related to real money they cannot be deleted once they have been succesful. For such purpose a dispute process should be done where the target entity that received the money creates another operation to balance the account again in the principles of banking and financial systems. The only attribute that could be modified once a transaction is done is the `description` which is mostly for the end-user purposes and does not affect the balances.

## Create

> Roles: **admin**, **customer**

Creates a new transaction for the given type and the given amount. This transaction is executed on behalf of the user passed as parameter so if the calling client is not the user of the resource the endpoint will return a `401 unauthorized` http error unless the calling client is an `admin`

In order to create transactions the client must provide the type of transaction that needs to be executed which is limited to the ones that are available to wallets being:

 - `transfer` transfer money from the calling client to another customer wallet.
 - `deposit` charge the wallet from an existing credit or debit card from the customer.
 - `withdrawal` move money from the wallet to a customer's debit or credit card.

The other two types are not available for use, that is `flat_fee` and `variable_fee` since they are created or triggered by other transactions automatically. These are not even available for admin users.

Depending on the type of transaction the client must provide the ID of a _"transactionable"_ object which can be either a wallet from another user for transfers between users or a card from the calling client in case of a deposit or withdrawal. Naturally, a client can only transfer money from his/her wallet to another and not the other way around and can also only withdraw from or deposit to his/her own cards.

For operations that involve interaction with 3rd parties such as other banks if a problem occurs on the third party a `502 bad gateway` error will be returned. This is a possible scenario if there is a downtime or connection problem to the credit or debit card issuer. Also note that insuficient funds or problems with the account itself do not account as gateway problems.

Finally, an important thing to consider is that the calling client must have enough funds on the wallet for the operation to succeeed in the case of wallet-to-wallet transfer because of the fees considering that the operation is actually the desired transfer amount + fees. If there are not enough funds then the request will fail.

# Cards

Cards are used in the system for two purposes mainly: to transfer money to or from the wallet. A card can be either a credit or debit card regardless of the bank.

While a wallet does not need a card, it is the only way to charge the wallet unless another user transfers money to the other user wallet. Also, to withdraw the money the user would need a card that the money can be transfered to.

Although initially the whole set of data from the card is requested we do not store it for security reasons. The only data that will be stored are the last 4 digits to keep a reference for statement purposes and also the expiration date to notify the user whenever the card is about to expire or in the case that a transaction is to be made with a card that has expired to avoid costs involved with failed charges common on financial systems.

Also, a card cannot be modified. If a user wishes to edit data from a card then the card needs to be removed and added back.

Lastly, if the card has been already involved in transactions a _soft delete_ is going to happen in order to keep integrity of the data. Since no personal information is stored from the cards there is no concern of data at store even if the customer decided to remove the card. The field `status` will set this and it can be either `active` or `removed`.

## Create

> Roles: **admin**, **customer**

# Fees

Fees are objects that set how much is charged per each transaction, particularily those between wallets. Each transaction will have both a flat fee charge and a variable rate fee calculated from the transfer amount. These fees are then withdrawn from the customer's wallet.

These fees are basically upper and lower bounds for amounts tied to the fee amount and the variable rate or ranges. These endpoints are all for administrative purposes so no regular `customer` type of account can access them.

Fee records do not have relation between transactions and instead the historic balance field and description are used to store at a certain point of time this information as rates may change with time.
